BEAST XML files for analyses summarized in Figure 1 of the BEAST X manuscript:

- Alpha_B.1.1.7_DoublingTime.xml: doubling time estimation under an exponential growth coalescent model for an SARS-CoV-2 Alpha data set that was previously analysed to study the origins and molecular evolution of this lineage (Hill et al., 2022). 

- Omicron_BA.1_DoublingTime.xml: doubling time estimation under an exponential growth coalescent model for an SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 data set, which is a subset of genomes of the largest BA.1 transmission lineage identified in the England (Tsui et al., 2023).

- Omicron_BA.1.17_ContinuousPhylogeography.xml: a relaxed random walk (RRW) model analysis of the latitudes and longitudes (randomly drawn from within the LTLA of sampling) for the largest BA.1 transmission lineage identified in England (Tsui et al., 2023). The model is fitted onto a fixed phylogenetic tree.

- Omicron_BA.1.17_Skygrid.xml: estimation of log effective population size (Ne) through time under a non-parameteric skygrid coalescent model for the largest BA.1 transmission lineage identified in England (Tsui et al., 2023). The model is fitted onto a set of empirical phylogenetic trees (Omicron_BA.1.17_EmpiricalTrees.nexus).

- Omicron_BA.1.17_EBDS.xml: estimation of the effective reproduction number (Re) through time using an episodic birth-death-sampling model fitted to the same set of empirical trees (Omicron_BA.1.17_EmpiricalTrees.nexus) for the largest BA.1 transmission lineage identified in England (Tsui et al., 2023).
