================================================================================


Version 1.6.2 released 22nd August 2011

    New Features:
        adds a "Beta Diversity" statistic to TreeStat program. This statistic
        takes a tree of two sets of species and computes the percentage of
        the tree length shared by the two taxa sets.

        allows BEAUti 'Guess Dates' dialog to parse out calendar dates from
        the taxon names.

        Updates all native nucleotide likelihood core files into 64 bit.
        For 32 bit machines, the user needs to rename the 32 bit files
        (e.g. for Windows, rename NucleotideLikelihoodCore32.dll into
        NucleotideLikelihoodCore.dll) to replace the current 64 bit files.

Version 1.6.0 released 15th September 2010

	New Features:
	    Random local clock model, see:
	        Drummond AJ and Suchard MA (2010) Bayesian random local clocks or one
	        rate to rule them all. BMC Biology.

	    Discrete trait models, see:
            Lemey P, Rambaut A, Drummond AJ & Suchard MA (2009) Bayesian
            Phylogeography Finds Its Roots.PLoS Comput Biol 5, e1000520.
	        http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tutorials#Phylogeography_tutorials

	    Continuous trait models, see:
            Lemey P, Rambaut A, Welch JJ & Suchard MA Phylogeography takes a
            relaxed random walk in continuous space and time. (2010)
            Mol Biol Evol 27, 1877-1886.
            These models are not currently specifiable from BEAUti, but see here:
            http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tutorials#Phylogeography_tutorials

        Improved user interface for Discrete Trait models in BEAUti.

	    Added 'includeStem' alias as 'forParent' attribute in Taxon Set in BEAUti.
	    This allows the calibration to be specified for the stem of a clade.

	    Added the application TreeStat to the BEAST package.

	    Can 'drag and drop' files to the data table in BEAUti to import them.

        New 'tool tip' help messages for most user-interface elements in BEAUti

        The name of the XML file is now shown in the title bar of the BEAST window.

        By default, BEAST will no longer overwrite existing log/trees files. This
        behaviour can be overridden by using the '-overwrite' command line option
        or the check box in the options dialog box.

        There is a BEAST new command line option '-prefix XXX' which will add the
        specified text to start of the file names of all log files and trees files
        for that run. This is useful for batch running of BEAST.

        More warnings are given now about potentially problematic prior choices,
        in particular the use of improper priors. These are shown in yellow.
        For some models, the user now has to make an explicit prior choice.

	    Issue 40:  TreeAnnotator produces misleading medians and HPDs when calculated
	               from only 1 tree.

        Issue 200: BEAUTi: *BEAST using Import Trait cannot add species in Trait table

 Version 1.5.1 released 3rd September 2009

	New Features:
	    *BEAST: a version of BEAST that can estimate species trees from
	    multi-locus multi-individual data sets using the multispecies coalescent
	    (Heled & Drummond, 2009, submitted)

	    BEAUti overhaul: BEAUti has been completely re-written to allow flexible
	    handling of multi-partition analyses, including partitioning by
	    substitution models, clock models and trees. BEAUti also supports the
	    new *BEAST method.

	    Relaxed clock refinements: The uncorrelated relaxed clock models have
	    been refined by the addition of two new operators to address (valid)
	    criticisms levelled in "Bayesian estimation of species divergence times
	    from multiple loci using multiple calibrations", Rannala and Yang (2007).
	    The change allows more than one branch to have the same relaxed clock
	    rate category. In practice this will only have any appreciable impact on
	    trees that have a small number of branches (< 15 taxa).

	Bug Fixes
		Many bugs fixed that were introduced in 1.5.0 including:

		Issue 38: If partitions are unlinked then the base frequencies should be
	              calculated from each partition separately;
		Issue 80: ant build generates a broken beast;
		Issue 81: ant build release fails after recent changes to beauti;
		Issue 82: dr.app.util.Utils is broken (use of java 1.6 features?);

Version 1.5.0 released 4th August 2009
	This was a major new version with numerous new features and many bugs -
	see release 1.5.1 for details.

	Bug Fixes
		Many new bugs were introduced.

================================================================================

Version 1.4.8 released 27th July 2008
	New Features:
		A birth-death model of speciation. This is the model of Tanja Gernhard
		(The conditioned reconstructed process, J Theor Biol, 2008).

		There is now an option to dynamically rescale the likelihoods of trees
		to avoid loss of precision. This can avoid problems with large trees
		but may affect performance. See on-line documentation for details.

	Bug Fixes:
		Improvements to how uncorrelated relaxed clocks are sampled. This will
		be an improvement more for small trees than large.

		Fixed a problem setting the number of groups for the Bayesian Skyline
		Plot in BEAUti.

		A warning message is given if a speciation process is selected for
		serially-sampled sequences.

		LogCombiner ignores lines starting with a '#' as a comment line.

		Trees are written with a standard (alphabetical) ordering of taxa to
		allow them to be read by AWTY.

		For writing NEXUS tree files, taxon names with illegal characters (such
		as spaces or semicolons) are now quoted.

		LogCombiner now uses the '.' as the decimal separator irrespective of
		country or language. This is to standardize with other programs.

Version 1.4.7 released 1st February 2008
	New Features:
		BEAUti can now set nucleotide frequencies to be sampled or equal as well
		as the empirically estimated (the previous default).

		Individual operators can now be turned on and off in BEAUti (for example
		to sample on a fixed tree topology).

	Bug Fixes:
		BEAST now generates starting trees with certain taxon constraints that
		caused problems before.

		Some numerical problems with the Expansion and Logistic models have been
		fixed or at least improved for certain situations.

		Fixed a problem in which BEAUti's Prior Distribution dialog was freezing
		when a very large lognormal mean was set.

		A seed of zero crashed BEAST - seeds must be > 0 now.

		The command-line version of TreeAnnotator wasn't accepting a target tree
		file name.

		Fixed a problem in LogCombiner where if the Run button was pressed
		before the user had finished editing a burnin the value was ignored.

		Fixed an issue with BEAUti running under Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) where
		the text box for the substitution rate was tiny.

Version 1.4.6 released 26th September 2007
	Bug Fixes:
		Fixed a problem in which the lognormal distribution wasn't giving the
		required distribution as prior.

		Fixed a problem with TreeAnnotator not completing when finding the
		Maximum Clade Credibility tree.

Version 1.4.5 released 31st July 2007
	Bug Fixes
		Some monophyletic constraints defined in BEAUti failed to run in BEAST.

		The priors table didn't update when the tree prior was changed.

Version 1.4.4 released 12th July 2007
	New Features:
		Improved speed of relaxed clock by more judicious updating of the
		likelihood when rates change on a few branches.

		Slight improvement in speed calculating the coalescent prior.

		The taxa and translate lists in NEXUS trees files can now be sorted
		alphabetically (and this is the default in BEAUti). This will help
		comparisons of trees files using certain software that assume taxon
		orders are the same (namely AWTY).

	Bug Fixes
		Log normal prior element required meanInRealSpace attribute which
		prevented older XML file from running without modification. This
		attribute is now optional.

Version 1.4.3 released 18th June 2007
	Bug Fixes
		The Yule tree prior was wrongly implemented.

		BEAUti did not allow some types of compatable monophyly
		constraints.

		BEAST did not always simulate starting trees with enforced
		monophyly correctly.

		BEAST ignored specified offsets for exponential priors on
		parameters.

		BEAUti ignored user specified offsets for gamma distribution
		priors on parameters.

Version 1.4.2 released 25th April 2007
	New Features:
		Taxon sets can now have monophyly enforced using BEAUti.

		Starting tree is now compatible with monophyly constraints
		and uniform priors on tMRCAs.

		Relaxed clock statistics (meanRate, etc.) are now in the priors
		table.

	Bug Fixes
		Fixed problem with rate estimation under the 2 partition codon
		specific rates models (including SRD06).

		Fixed problem setting Bayesian Skyline group count in BEAUti.

Version 1.4.1 released 25th January 2007
	Bug Fixes:
		BEAUti did not accept the number of skyline groups properly.

		BEAUti was not able to 'guess dates' using a specified prefix.

		Fixed a problem using exponential distribution as priors.

		LogCombiner could mix up taxon labels when combining multiple
		tree files. This problem would not affect the reconstruction of
		skyline plots.

Version 1.4 released 31th October 2006
	New Features:
		Faster likelihood calculations after rejecting a state. Whilst
		the improvement in speed will vary, the indications are that
		this is a significant overall speed improvement.

		Rates for relaxed clock models can be written embedded in the
		tree for later analysis.

		2 new accessory programs: LogCombiner for combining multiple
		runs into single log files and TreeAnnotator which annotates a
		given target tree with posterior estimates from a BEAST sample
		of trees.

		BEAUti can now create TaxonSets and apply prior probability
		distributions to the tMRCA of these.

		BEAUti can now save and load "Template Files" containing model
		settings but not data.

		BEAUti can be run non-interactively as a command-line using the
		template files.

		The order of parameters logged in BEAST files created by BEAUti
		has been changed to make it easier to compare files with different
		models in Tracer.

	Bug Fixes:
		BEAUti did not use the specified fixed substitution rate.

		Fixed a problem using UPGMA as an initial tree - would sometimes
		give ? in log files instead of posteriors.

		Fixed a problem with BEAUti not loading data when using a non-
		english operating system.

		Fixed a problem using gamma distribution as priors.

Version 1.3 released 30th August 2005
	New Features:
		"Relaxed Clock" models.
		New prior selection for parameters using BEAUti.

	Bug Fixes:
		Problem with distributionLikelihood including all data twice
		resulting in the distributions being too tight.

		Improved error reporting.

Version 1.2 released 24th February 2005
	New Features:
		"Bayesian Skyline" demographic model.
		Logistic demographic model.

Version 1.1.2 released 27th August 2004
	Bug Fixes:
		Amino Acid models were not being set correctly
		resulting in the use of an equal-rates model.

Version 1.1.1 released 24th August 2004
	New Features:
		Can now switch autoOptimize on or off for individual
		operators. This overrides the setting for the <mcmc>
		element.

		Default weights for certain operators have been changed
		in BEAUti to improve performance.

	Bug Fixes:
		Fixed a bug in BEAUti in which unlinked codon analyses
		produced non-working XML files.

		Fixed a bug where BEAST wouldn't run certain old XML files
		throwing a null-pointer exception when writing a log file.

		Doesn't stop with RuntimeException when a state is proposed
		that has a really bad (underflowing) likelihood.

Version 1.1 released 5th August 2004
	New Features:
		An auto-optimize function that removes the need to
		perform manual tuning of operators.

		Improvement in speed of likelihood calculations for
		nucleotides.

		Now includes BEAUTi as part of the BEAST package. In
		future these will be distributed together with matching
		version numbers.

	Bug Fixes:
		Various minor problems with parsing XML have been fixed

Version 1.0.3 released 12 July 2003
	New Features:
		Improved tree log analyser. Now gives mean node heights
		(branch lengths) on trees with a frequency > 100.

	Bug Fixes:
		Various minor problems with parsing XML have been fixed

Version 1.0.2 released 27 June 2003
	New Features:
		Improved tree log analyser. Now gives mean node heights
		(branch lengths) on trees with a frequency > 100.

	Bug Fixes:
		Fixed the wrong coalescent likelihood function introduced
		in the last version.

		Various minor problems with parsing XML have been fixed
		(including GTR model, NormalDistribution and others).

Version 1.0.1 released 23 June 2003
	This version introduced a 'fix' for the coalescent likelihood
	function which turned out to be erroneous. This version should
	not be used.

Version 1.0 released 10 June 2003
	First released version.
