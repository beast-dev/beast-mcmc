/**
 * Simple program to splice a set of (probably simulated) beast files containting sequences
 * with a fixed second half containing some analysis setup. The first half, up to but not
 * including the line '\t<patterns id="patterns" from="1">' comes from a set of XML numbered
 * from 1 to 100, the second half is read from a specified file and a new set numbered 1 to
 * 100 is created.
