/**
 * This class implements a vector of bits that grows as needed. Each
 * component of the bit set has a {@code boolean} value. The
 * bits of a {@code BitSet} are indexed by nonnegative integers.
 * Individual indexed bits can be examined, set, or cleared. One
 * {@code BitSet} may be used to modify the contents of another
 * {@code BitSet} through logical AND, logical inclusive OR, and
 * logical exclusive OR operations.
 *
 * <p>By default, all bits in the set initially have the value
 * {@code false}.
 *
 * <p>Every bit set has a current size, which is the number of bits
 * of space currently in use by the bit set. Note that the size is
 * related to the implementation of a bit set, so it may change with
 * implementation. The length of a bit set relates to logical length
 * of a bit set and is defined independently of implementation.
 *
 * <p>Unless otherwise noted, passing a null parameter to any of the
 * methods in a {@code BitSet} will result in a
 * {@code NullPointerException}.
 *
 * <p>A {@code BitSet} is not safe for multithreaded use without
 * external synchronization.
