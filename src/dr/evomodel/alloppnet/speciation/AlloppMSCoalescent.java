/*
 * AlloppMSCoalescent, AlloppSpeciesNetworkModel, AlloppLeggedTree,
 * AlloppDiploidHistory, and AlloppSpeciesBindings collaborate closely.
 * 
 * AlloppSpeciesNetworkModel contains an AlloppDiploidHistory and an array of
 * AlloppLeggedTree's for representing the tetraploid trees. It also contains a
 * multiply labelled tree as an alternative representation.
 * 
 * AlloppSpeciesBindings represents the species-individual-genome structure
 * of the data, and contains the gene trees.
 * 
 * This module, AlloppMSCoalescent, uses AlloppSpeciesNetworkModel and 
 * AlloppSpeciesBindings to calculate P(g_i|S) = probability that gene tree
 * g_i fits into network S.
 * 
 * apsp.geneTreeFitsInNetwork calls
 *   FitsInNetwork (inside a gene tree) calls
 *     subTreeFitsInNetwork (recursive, inside a gene tree) calls
 *        CoalescenceIsCompatible to test a single coalescence against mullab tree
 *        
 * apsp.geneTreeLogLikelihood calls
 *   TreeLogLikelihood  (inside a gene tree) calls
 *     clearCoalescences (in mullab tree) and
 *     recordCoalescence (in mullab tree) and
 *     recordLineageCounts (in mullab tree) and
 *     to set up data in mullab tree nodes, then
 *     mullabTreeLogLikelihood which calls
 *       mullabSubTreeLogLikelihood (recursive, in mullab tree) calls
 *         limbLogLike calls
 *           limbLinPopIntegral
