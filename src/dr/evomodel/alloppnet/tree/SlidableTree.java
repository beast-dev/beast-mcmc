/*
The aim is to simplify code by not having to use a MutableTree with its long list of
methods. The users of SlidableTree are

1. AlloppLeggedTree, for moves within tetraploid subtrees.

2. AlloppDiploidHistory. A SimpleTree is made for testing purposes.

3. PopsIOSpeciesTreeModel. Needs to be a Tree for logging. So I
make and update a SimpleTree and delegate to that.

4. MulSpeciesTreeModel does not use it yet, but could do. Currently a MutableTree and
uses near-copy of JH's code for MCMC moves. Same issue as PopsIOSpeciesTreeModel if use
SlidableTree.

It uses NodeRefs cause that's what SimpleTree uses. This means that clients have
to implement get/setNumber when they have no use for node numbers.
