\chapter{Theory}

\section{Background}

Evolution and statistics are two common themes that pervade the modern
analysis of molecular sequence variation. It is now widely accepted
that most questions regarding molecular sequences are statistical
in nature and should be framed in terms of parameter estimation and
hypothesis testing. Similarly it is evident that to produce accurate
models of molecular sequence variation an evolutionary perspective
is required. With apologies to Dobzhansky, nothing in bioinformatics
makes sense except in the light of evolution.

The BEAST software package is an ambitious attempt to provide a general
framework for parameter estimation and hypothesis testing of evolutionary
models from molecular sequence data. BEAST is a Bayesian statistical
framework and thus provides a role for prior knowledge in combination with the
information provided by the data. Bayesian MCMC has already been enthusiastically embraced
as the state-of-the-art method for phylogenetic reconstruction, largely
driven by the rapid and widespread adoption of \textbf{\textsc{MrBayes}}
\cite{HR2001}. This enthusiasm can be attributed to a number of factors.
Firstly, Bayesian methods allow the relatively straightforward implementation
of extremely complex evolutionary models. Secondly, there is an often erroneous
perception that Bayesian estimation is {}``faster'' than heuristic
optimization based on a maximum likelihood criterion. 

In addition to phylogenetic inference, a number of researchers have
recently developed Bayesian MCMC software for coalescent-based estimation
of demographic parameters from genetic data \cite{DNRS2002,WWB2003,Beaumont1999,RY2003,PDNRR2003,Kuhner2006}.
Like phylogenetic analysis, these also require a gene tree in the
underlying model, although in this setting, the sequences represent
different individuals from the same species, rather than from different
species.

Most recently, Bayesian MCMC has also been applied to a central problem in evolutionary bioinformatics: the co-estimation
of phylogeny and alignment \cite{LMDJH2005,RS2005}. Taken together
with progress in phylogenetics and coalescent-based population genetics,
Bayesian MCMC has been applied to most of the evolutionary questions
commonly asked of molecular data. 

BEAST can be compared to a number of other software packages with
similar goals, such as \textbf{\textsc{MrBayes}} \cite{HR2001}, which
currently focuses on phylogenetic inference and \textbf{\textsc{Batwing}}
\cite{WWB2003} which focuses predominanty on coalescent-based population
genetics. Like these software packages, the core algorithm implemented
in BEAST is Metropolis-Hastings MCMC \cite{MRRTT1953,Hastings1970}.
MCMC is a stochastic algorithm that produces sample-based estimates
of a target distribution of choice. For our purposes the target distribution
is the posterior distribution of a set of evolutionary parameters
given a set of molecular sequences. 

Possibly the most distinguishing feature of BEAST is its firm focus
on calibrated phylogenies and genealogies, that is, rooted trees incorporating
a time-scale. This is achieved by explicitly modeling the rate of
molecular evolution on each branch in the tree. On the simplest level
this can be a uniform rate over the entire tree (i.e. the molecular
clock model \cite{ZP1965}) with this rate known in advance or estimated
from calibration information. However, one of the most promising recent
advances in molecular phylogenetics has been the introduction of \emph{relaxed
molecular clock} models that do not assume a constant rate across
lineages\cite{TKP1998,YY2000,KTB2001,Sanderson2002,TK2002,AY2003}.
BEAST was the first software package that allows phylogenetic inference
under such models \cite{DHPR2006}. 

The purpose behind the development of BEAST is to bring a large number
of complementary evolutionary models (substitution models, insertion-deletion
models, demographic models, tree shape priors, relaxed clock models,
node calibration models) into a single coherent framework for evolutionary
inference. This building-block principle of constructing a complex
evolutionary model out of a number of simpler model components provides
powerful new possibilities for molecular sequence analysis. The motivation
for doing this is (1) to avoid the unnecessary simplifying assumptions
that currently exist in many evolutionary analysis packages and (2)
to provide new model combinations and a flexible system for model
specification so that researchers can tailor their evolutionary analyses
to their specific set of questions.

The ambition of this project requires teamwork, and we hope that by
making the source code of BEAST freely available, the range of models
implemented, while already large, will continue to grow and diversify. 


\section{Implementation}

The overall architecture of the BEAST software package is a file-mediated
pipeline. The core program takes, as input, an XML file describing
the data to be analyzed, the models to be used and technical details
of the MCMC algorithm such as the proposal distribution (operators),
the chain length and the output options. The output of a BEAST analysis
is a set of tab-delimited plain text files that summarize the estimated
posterior distribution of parameter values and trees. 

A number of additional software programs assist in generating the
input and analyzing the output:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textsc{BEAUti}} is a software package written in Java and
distributed with BEAST that provides a graphical user interface for
generating BEAST XML input files for a number of simple model combinations. 
\item \textbf{\textsc{Tracer}} is a software package written in Java and
distributed separately from BEAST that provides a graphical tool for
MCMC output analysis. It can be used for the analysis of the output
of BEAST as well as the output of other common MCMC packages such
as \textbf{\textsc{MrBayes}} \cite{HR2001} and \textbf{\textsc{BAli-Phy}}
\cite{SR2006}.
\end{itemize}
Because of the combinatorial nature of the BEAST XML input format,
not all models can be specified through the graphical interface of
\textbf{\textsc{BEAUti}}. Indeed, the sheer number of possible combinations
of models mean that, inevitably, many combinations will essentially
be untried and untested. It is also possible to create models that
are inappropriate or meaningless for the data being analyses. \textbf{\textsc{BEAUti}}
is therefore intended as a way of generating commonly used and well-understood
analyses. For the more adventurous researcher, and with the above
warnings in mind, the XML file can be directly edited. A number of
online tutorials are available to guide users on how to do this. 


\subsection*{Input Format}

One of the primary motivations for providing a highly structured XML
input format is to facilitate reproducibility of complex evolutionary
analyses. While an interactive graphical user interface provides a
pleasant user experience, it can be time-consuming and error-prone
for a user to record and reproduce the full sequence of choices that
are made, especially with the large array of options typically available
for MCMC analysis. By separating the graphical user interface (BEAUti)
from the analysis (BEAST) we accommodate an XML layer that captures
the exact details of the MCMC analysis being performed. We strongly
encourage the routine publication of XML input files as supplementary
information with publication of the results of a BEAST analysis. Because
of the non-trivial nature of MCMC analyses and the need to promote
reproducibility, it is our view that the publication of the exact
details of any Bayesian MCMC analysis should be made a pre-requisite
for publication of all MCMC analysis results.


\subsection*{Output and results}

The output from BEAST is a simple tab-delimited plain text file format
with one a row for each sample. When accumulated into frequency distributions,
this file provides an estimate of the marginal posterior probability
distribution of each parameter. This can be done using any standard
statistics package or using the specially written package, \textbf{\textsc{Tracer}}
\cite{RD2003}. \textbf{\textsc{Tracer}} provides a number of graphical and statistical 
ways of analyzing the output of BEAST to check performance and accuracy. 
It also provides specialized functions for summarizing the posterior distribution of
population size through time when a coalescent model is used.

The phylogenetic tree of each sample state is written to a separate
file as either NEWICK or NEXUS format. This can be used to investigate
the posterior probability of various phylogenetic questions such as
the monophyly of a particular group of organisms or to obtain a consensus
phylogeny.


\subsection*{Computational Performance}

Although there is always a trade-off between a program's flexibility
and its computational performance, BEAST performs well on large analyses
(e.g. \cite{Shapiroetal2004}). A Bayesian MCMC algorithm needs to
evaluate the likelihood of each state in the chain and thus performance
is dictated by the speed at which these likelihood evaluations can
be made. BEAST attempts to minimize the time taken to evaluate a state
by only recalculating the likelihood for parts of the model that have
changed from the previous state. Furthermore, the core computational
functions have been implemented in the C programming language. This
can be compiled into a highly optimized library for a given platform
providing an improvement in speed. If this library is not found, BEAST
will use its Java version of these functions, thereby retaining its
platform-independence. 


\section{Results and Discussion}

BEAST provides considerable flexibility in the specification of an
evolutionary model. For example, consider the analysis of a multiple
sequence alignment of coding DNA. In a BEAST analysis, it is possible
to allow each codon position to have a different rate, a different
amount of rate heterogeneity among sites, and a different amount of
rate heterogeneity among branches, while, at the same time, sharing
the same intrinsic ratio of transitions to transversions with the
other codon positions. In fact, all parameters can be shared or made
independent among partitions of the sequence data. 

An unavoidable feature of Bayesian statistical analysis is the specification
of a prior distribution over parameter values. This requirement is
both an advantage and a burden. It is an advantage because relevant
knowledge such as palaeontological calibration of phylogenies is readily
incorporated into an analysis. However, when no obvious prior distribution
for a parameter exists, a burden is placed on the researcher to ensure
that the prior selected is not inadvertently influencing the posterior
distribution of parameters of interest.

In BEAST, all parameters (whether they be substitutional, demographic or genealogical)
can be given informative priors (e.g. exponential, normal, lognormal
or uniform with bounds, or combinations of these). For example, the age of the root of the tree
can be given an exponential prior with a pre-specified mean. 

The five components of an evolutionary model for a set of aligned
nucleotides in BEAST are: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Substitution model - The substitution model is a homogeneous Markov
process that defines the relative rates at which different substitutions
occur along a branch in the tree.
\item Rate model among sites - The rate model among sites defines the distribution
of relative rates of evolutionary change among sites.
\item Rate model among branches - The rate model among branches defines
the distribution of rates among branches and is used to convert the
tree, which is in units of time, to units of substitutions. These
models are important for divergence time estimation procedures.
\item Tree - a model of the phylogenetic or genealogical relationships of
the sequences.
\item Tree prior - The tree prior provides a parameterized prior distribution
for the node heights (in units of time) and tree topology. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Substitution models and rate models among sites}

For nucleotide data, all of the models that are nested in the general
time-reversible (GTR) model \cite{ROMM1990} - including the well
known HKY85 model \cite{HKY1985} - can be specified. For the analysis
of amino acid sequence alignments all of the following replacement
models can be used: Blosum62, CPREV, Dayhoff, JTT, MTREV and WAG.
When nucleotide data represents a coding sequence (i.e. an in-frame
exon) the Goldman and Yang model \cite{GY1994} can be used to model
codon evolution. 

In addition, both $\Gamma$-distributed rates among sites \cite{Y1994}
and a proportion of invariant sites can be used to describe rate heterogeneity
among sites.


\subsection*{Rate models among branches, divergence time estimation and time-stamped
data}

The basic model for rates among branches supported by BEAST is the
strict molecular clock model \cite{ZP1965}, calibrated by specifying
either a substitution rate or the date of a node or set of nodes.
In this context, dates of divergence for particular clades can be
estimated. The clades can be defined either by a monophyletic grouping
of taxa or as the most recent common ancestor of a set of taxa of
interest. The second alternative does not require monophyly of the
selected taxa with respect to the rest of the tree. Furthermore, when
the differences in the dates associated with the tips of the tree
comprise a significant proportion of the age of the entire tree, these
dates can be incorporated into the model providing a source of information
about the overall rate of evolutionary change \cite{DNRS2002,DPRFR2003}.

In BEAST, divergence time estimation has also been extended to include
\emph{relaxed phylogenetics} models, in which the rate of evolution
is allowed to vary among the branches of the tree. In particular we
support a class of uncorrelated relaxed clock branch rate models,
in which the rate at each branch is drawn from an underlying distribution
such as exponential or lognormal \cite{DHPR2006}.

If the sequence data are all from one time point, then the overall
evolutionary rate must be specified with a strong prior. The units
implied by the prior on the evolutionary rate will determine the units
of the node heights in the tree (including the age of the most recent
common ancestor) as well as the units of the demographic parameters
such as the population size parameter and the growth rate. For example,
if the evolutionary rate is set to 1.0, then the node heights (and
root height) will be in units of mutations per site (i.e. the units
of branch lengths produced by common software packages such as \textbf{\textsc{MrBayes}}
3.0). Similarly, for a haploid population, the coalescent parameter
will be an estimate of $N_{e}\mu$. However, if, for example, the
evolutionary rate is expressed in mutations per site per year, then
the branches in the tree will be in units of years. Furthermore the
population size parameter of the demographic model will then be equal
to $N_{e}\tau$, where $N_{e}$ is the effective population size and
$\tau$ is the generation length in years. Finally, if the evolutionary
rate is expressed in units of mutations per site per generation then
the resulting tree will be in units of generations and the population
parameter of the demographic model will be in natural units (i.e.
will be equal to the effective number of reproducing individuals,
$N_{e}$).


\subsection*{Tree Priors}

When sequence data has been collected from a homogenous population,
various coalescent \cite{Kingman1982,GT1994} models of demographic
history can be used in BEAST to model population size changes through
time. At present the simple parametric models available include constant
size $N(t)=N_{e}$ (1 parameter), exponential growth $N(t)=N_{e}e^{-gt}$
(2 parameters) and logistic growth (3 parameters). 

In addition, the highly parametric Bayesian skyline plot \cite{DRSP2005}
is also available, but this model can only be used when the data are
strongly informative about population history. All of these demographic
models are parametric priors on the ages of nodes in the tree, in
which the hyperparameters (e.g., population size, $N_{e}$, and growth
rate, $g$) can be sampled and estimated. As well as performing single
locus coalescent-based inference, two or more unlinked gene trees
can be simultaneously analyzed under the same demographic model. Sophisticated
multi-locus coalescent inference can be achieved by allocating a separate
overall rate and substitution process for each locus, thereby accommodating
loci with heterogeneous evolutionary processes.

At present there are only a limited number of options for non-coalescent
priors on tree shape and branching rate. Currently a simple Yule prior
on birth rate of new lineages (1 parameter) can be employed. However,
generalized birth-death tree priors are currently under development.
Futhermore, Aldous's beta-splitting model \cite{Aldous2001} (1 parameter)
is also available as a prior on tree shape, if the balance/imbalance
of the tree topology is important.

In addition to general models of branching times such as the coalescent
and Yule priors, the tree prior may also include specific distributions
and/or constraints on certain node heights and topological features.
These additional priors may represent other sources of knowledge such
as expert interpretation of the fossil record. For example, as briefly
noted above, each node in the tree can have a prior distribution representing
knowledge of its date. A recent paper on {}``relaxed phylogenetics''
contains more information on calibration priors \cite{DHPR2006}. 


\subsection*{Insertion-deletion models}

Finally, BEAST also has a model of the insertion-deletion process.
This provides the ability to co-estimate the phylogeny and the multiple
sequence alignment. Currently only the TKF91 model of insertion-deletion
\cite{TKF1991} is available. Interested readers should refer to the
paper on this subject for more details \cite{LMDJH2005}.


\subsection*{Multiple data partitions and linking and unlinking parameters}

BEAST provides the ability to analyze multiple data partitions simultaneously.
This is useful when combining multiple genes in a single multi-locus
coalescent analysis (e.g. \cite{Lemeyetal2004}) or to allocate different
evolutionary processes to different regions of a sequence alignment
(such as the codon positions; e.g. \cite{PDNRR2003}). The parameters
of the substitution model, the rate model among sites, the rate model
among branches, the tree, and the tree prior can all be 'linked' or
'unlinked' in a analysis involving multiple partitions. For example
in an analysis of HIV-1 group O by Lemey \emph{et al} \cite{Lemeyetal2004},
three loci (gag, int, pol) were assumed to share the same substitution
model parameters (GTR), as well as sharing the same demographic history
of exponential growth. However they were assumed to have different
shape parameters for $\Gamma$-distributed rate heterogeneity among
sites, different rate parameters for the strict molecular clock and
the three tree topologies and sets of divergence times were also assumed
to be independent and unlinked. 

\subsection*{Definitions and units of the standard parameters and variables}

Crucial to the interpretation of all BEAST parameters is an understanding of the units that the tree is measured in. The simplest situation occurs when no calibration information is available, either from knowledge of the rate of evolution of the gene region, or from knowledge of the age of any of the nodes in the tree. If this is the case the rate of evolution is set to 1.0 (via the \texttt{\small{clock.rate}} or \texttt{\small{ucld.mean}} parameters) and the branch lengths in the tree are then in substitutions per site. However if the rate of evolution is known in substitutions per site per unit time, then the genealogy will be expressed in the relevant time units. Likewise, if the age of one or more nodes (internal or external) are known then this will also provide the units for the rest of the branch lengths and the rate of evolution. With this in mind, the following table lists the parameters that can be generated by BEAUTi, their interpretation and units.

\begin{lyxlist}{00.00.0000000000000000}
\item [\texttt{\small{clock.rate}}] The rate of strict molecular clock. The units of this parameter are in substitutions per site per unit time. If this parameter is fixed to 1.0 then the branch lengths in the tree will be in units of substitutions per site. However, if, for example, the tree is being calibrated by using fossil calibrations on internal nodes and those fossil dates are expressed in millions of years ago (Mya), then the \texttt{\small{clock.rate}} parameter will be an estimate of the evolutionary rate in units of substitutions per site per million years (Myr).
\item [\texttt{\small{constant.popSize}}] This is the coalescent parameter under the assumption of a constant population size. This parameter represents the product of effective population size ($N_e$) and the generation length in units of time ($\tau$). Therefore, only if time is measured in generations is this parameter a direct estimate of $N_e$. Otherwise it is a composite parameter and $N_e$ can be computed from this parameter by dividing it by generation length in the units of time that your calibrations (or \texttt{\small{clock.rate}}) are defined in. Finally,  if \texttt{\small{clock.rate}} is set to $1.0$ then \texttt{\small{constant.popSize}} is an estimate of $N_e\mu$ for haploid data such as mitochondrial sequences and $2N_e\mu$ for diploid data, where $\mu$ is the substitution rate per site per generation.
\item [\texttt{\small{exponential.growthRate}}]	 This is the coalescent parameter representing the rate of growth of the population assuming exponential growth. The population size at time $t$ is determined by $N(t)=N_e\exp(-gt)$ where $t$ is in the same units as the branch lengths and $g$ is the \texttt{\small{exponential.growthRate}} parameter.
\item [\texttt{\small{exponential.popSize}}]	 This is the parameter representing the modern day population size assuming exponential growth. Like \texttt{\small{constant.popSize}}, it is a composite parameter unless the time scale of the genealogy is in generations.
\item [\texttt{\small{gtr.\{ac,ag,at,cg,gt\}}}]	 These five parameters are the relative rates of substitutions for $A{\leftrightarrow}C$,  $A{\leftrightarrow}G$,  $A{\leftrightarrow}T$,  $C{\leftrightarrow}G$ and  $G{\leftrightarrow}T$ in the general time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution \cite{ROMM1990}. In the default set up these parameters are relative to $r_{C{\leftrightarrow}T} = 1.0$.
\item [\texttt{\small{hky.kappa}}]	 This parameter is the transition/transversion ratio ($\kappa$) parameter of the HKY85 model of nucleotide substitution \cite{HKY1985}.
\item [\texttt{\small{siteModel.alpha}}]	 This parameter is the shape ($\alpha$) parameter of the $\Gamma$ distribution of rate heterogeneity among sites \cite{Y1994}.
\item [\texttt{\small{siteModel.pInv}}]	 This parameter is the proportion of  invariant sites ($p_{inv}$) and has a range between 0 and 1.
\item [\texttt{\small{treeModel.rootHeight}}]	 This variable represents the total height of the tree (often known as the time to the most recent common ancestor of all the taxa, $t_{MRCA}$). The units of this variable are the same as the units for the branch lengths in the tree and will depend on the calibration information for the rate and/or dates of calibration nodes.
\item [\texttt{\small{ucld.mean}}]	 This is the mean rate under the uncorrelated log-normal relaxed molecular clock (in real space). Under default BEAUTi options for the uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock this parameter has the same units as \texttt{\small{clock.rate}}.
\item [\texttt{\small{ucld.stdev}}] This is the standard deviation ($\sigma$) of the uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock (in log-space). If this parameter is 0 there is no variation in rates among branches. If this parameter is greater than 1 then the standard deviation in branch rates (in real space) is greater than the mean rate.
\item [\texttt{\small{yule.birthRate}}]	This parameter is the rate of lineage birth and the Yule model of speciation. If \texttt{\small{clock.rate}} is 1.0 then this parameter estimates the number of lineages born from a parent lineage per substitution per site. If the tree is instead measure in, for example, years, then this parameter would be the number of new lineages born from a single parent lineage per year.
\end{lyxlist}

\section{Conclusions}

BEAST is a flexible analysis package for evolutionary parameter estimation
and hypothesis testing. The component-based nature of model specification
in BEAST means that the number of different evolutionary models possible
is very large and therefore difficult to summarize. However a number
of published uses of the BEAST software already serve to highlight
the breadth of application the software enjoys \cite{PDNRR2003,Lemeyetal2004,Shapiroetal2004,DRSP2005,LMDJH2005}. 

BEAST is an actively developed package and enhancements for the next
version include (1) birth-death priors for tree shape (2) faster and
more flexible codon-based substitution models (3) the structured coalescent
to model subdivided populations with migration (4) models of continuous
character evolution and (5) new relaxed clock models based on random local molecular clocks. 

\chapter{Practice}

\section{The BEAST software package}

This chapter provides a step-by-step tutorial to converting a NEXUS file with a DATA or CHARACTERS block into a BEAST XML input file. This is done using the program BEAUti (this stands for Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Utility). This is a user-friendly program for setting the evolutionary model and options for the MCMC analysis.

\section{Running BEAUTi}

The exact instructions for running BEAUti differs depending on which computer you are using. Please see the README text file that was distributed with the version you downloaded. Once running, BEAUti will look similar irrespective of which computer system it is running on. For this tutorial, the Mac OS X version will be used in the Figures but the Linux and Windows versions will have exactly the same layout and functionality.

\section{Loading the NEXUS file}

To load a NEXUS format alignment, simply select the {\it Import NEXUS...} option from the File menu. The examples folder contains a file called \texttt{Dengue4.env.nex}. This file contains an alignment of 17 sequences from the {\it env} gene of Dengue-4 virus from various parts of the world with dates from 1956-1994 \cite{LGT1997, R2000}. Once loaded, the list of taxa and the actual alignment will be displayed in the main window (Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\scalebox{0.5}{\includegraphics{Figure_Beauti1.png}}
\end{center}
\caption{The data tab in BEAUTi}
\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}

\section{Setting the dates of the taxa}

If the NEXUS file contains a calibrations block then the dates will automatically be loaded. Otherwise, by default all the taxa are assumed to have a date of zero (i.e. the sequences are assumed to be sampled at the same time). In this case, the Dengue-4 virus have been sampled at various dates going back to the 1950s. The actual year of sampling is given in the name of each taxon and we could simply edit the value in the Date column of the table to reflect these. However the following subsections describe two simpler methods for specifying the sequence dates. 

\subsection{NEXUS Calibrations block}

One method for defining the tip calibrations in a serially sampled data set is to provide a calibrations block in the NEXUS file to be imported. The following calibrations block is used in the  \texttt{Dengue4.env.nex} file:

\begin{verbatim}
  BEGIN CALIBRATION;
    OPTIONS SCALE = years;
		
    TIPCALIBRATION
      94 = 1994:D4ElSal94,
      86 = 1986:D4PRico86,
      85 = 1985:D4Tahiti85,
      84 = 1984:D4Mexico84 D4Philip84 D4Thai84,
      82 = 1982:D4Brazi82,
      83 = 1983:D4ElSal83,
      81 = 1981:D4NewCal81,
      79 = 1979:D4Tahiti79,
      78 = 1978:D4SLanka78 D4Thai78,
      77 = 1977:D4Indon77,
      76 = 1976:D4Indon76,
      64 = 1964:D4Philip64,
      63 = 1963:D4Thai63,
      56 = 1956:D4Philip56
      ;
  END;
\end{verbatim}
 
 The format within the \texttt{TIPCALIBRATION} command is a comma-delimited list of calibrations followed by a semicolon. Each calibration is of the form:
 
\begin{verbatim}
  calibration-name = calibration-date:taxa-list
\end{verbatim}
 
The  {\it taxa-list} is a space-delimited list of the taxa to be calibrated with the given calibration date.
 
\subsection{Guessing the dates from the taxa names} 

If the taxa names contain the calibration information, then another convenient way to specify the dates of the sequences in BEAUTi is to use the "Guess Dates" button at the top of the Data tab. Clicking this will make a dialog box appear (Figure~\ref{fig:guessDatesFigure}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\scalebox{0.5}{\includegraphics{Figure_GuessDates.png}}
\end{center}
\caption{The Guess Dates dialog}
\label{fig:guessDatesFigure}
\end{figure}

This operation attempts to guess what the dates are from information contained within the taxon names. Generally this works by trying to find a numerical field within each name. If the taxon names contain more than one numerical field (such as the Dengue-4 sequences, above) then you can specify how to find the one that corresponds to the date of sampling. You can either specify the order that the date field comes (e.g., first, last or various positions in between) or specify a prefix (some characters that come immediately before the date field in each name). For the Dengue-4 sequences you select last from the drop-down menu for the order. If you left it at first then all taxa would be given a date of "4" taken from the second character of each name.

In this dialog box, you can also get BEAUti to add a fixed value to each guessed date. In this case the value "1900" has been added to turn the dates from 2 digit years to 4 digit. Any dates in the taxon names given as "00" would thus become "1900". If these dates were actually referring to the year 2000 then selecting the next option would convert them correctly, adding 2000 to any date less than 08.
When you press OK the dates will appear in the appropriate column of the main window. You can then check these and edit them manually as required. At the top of the window you can set the units that the dates are given in (years, months, days) and whether they are specified relative to a point in the past (as would be the case for years such as 1984) or backwards in time from the present (as in the case of ages).

\subsection{Translating the data in amino acid sequences}

At the bottom of the main window is the option to translate the data into amino acid sequences. This will be done using the genetic code specified in the associated drop down menu. If the loaded sequence are not nucleotides then this option will be disabled.

\section{Setting the evolutionary model}

The next thing to do is to click on the Model tab at the top of the main window. This will reveal the evolutionary model settings for BEAST. Exactly which options appear depend on whether the data are nucleotides or amino acids (or nucleotides translated into amino acids). Figure~\ref{fig:modelTab} shows the settings that will appear after loading the Dengue-4 data.

\caption{The evolutionary model settings in BEAUTi}
\label{fig:modelTab}
\end{figure}

This chapter assumes that you are familiar with the evolutionary models available, however there are a couple of points to note about selecting a model in BEAUTi:

\begin{itemize}
\item Selecting the {\it Partition into codon positions} option assumes that the data are aligned as codons. This option will then estimate a separate rate of substitution for each codon position, or for 1+2 versus 3, depending on the setting.
\item Selecting the {\it Unlink substitution model across codon positions} will specify that BEAST should estimate a separate transition-transversion ratio or general time reversible rate matrix for each codon position.
\item Selecting the {\it Unlink rate heterogeneity model across codon positions} will specify that BEAST should estimate set of rate heterogeneity parameters (gamma shape parameter and/or proportion of invariant sites) for each codon position.
\item If there are no dates for the sequences (they are contemporaneous) then you can specify a fixed {\it mean substitution rate} obtained from another source. Setting this to 1.0 will result in the ages of the nodes of the tree being estimated in units of substitutions per site (i.e. the normal units of branch lengths in popular packages such as MrBayes).
\end{itemize}

\section{Setting up the operators}

Each parameter in the model has one or more "operators" (these are variously called moves and proposals by other MCMC software packages such as MrBayes and Lamarc). The operators specify how the parameters change as the MCMC runs. This table lists the parameters, their operators and the tuning settings for these operators. In the first column are the parameter names. These will be called things like \texttt{hky1.kappa} which means the HKY model's kappa parameter (the transition-transversion bias). The next column has the type of operators that are acting on each parameter. For example, the scale operator scales the parameter up or down by a proportion, the random walk operator adds or subtracts an amount to the parameter and the uniform operator simply picks a new value uniformally within a range. Some parameters relate to the tree or to the divergence times of the nodes of the tree and these have special operators.

The next column, labelled {\it Tuning}, gives a tuning setting to the operator. Some operators don't have any tuning settings so have {\it n/a} under this column. The tuning parameter will determine how large a move each operator will make which will affect how often that change is accepted by the MCMC which will affect the efficency of the analysis. For most operators (like random walk and subtree slide operators) a larger tuning parameter means larger moves. However for the scale operator a tuning parameter value closer to 0.0 means bigger moves. At the top of the window is an option called {\it Auto Optimize} which, when selected, will automatically adjust the tuning setting as the MCMC runs to try to achieve maximum efficiency. At the end of the run a table of the operators, their performance and the final values of these tuning settings will be displayed. These can then be used to set the starting tuning settings in order to minimize the amount of time taken to reach optimum performance in subsequent runs.

The next column, labelled {\it Weight}, specifies how often each operator is applied relative to each other. Some parameters tend to be estimated very efficiently - an example is the kappa parameter - these parameters can have their operators down-weighted so that they are not changed as often (this may mean upweighting other operators since the weights must be integers).

\section{Setting the MCMC options}

Unsurprisingly, the {\it MCMC} tab in BEAUTi provides settings to control the MCMC chain. Firstly we have the {\it Length of chain}. This is the number of steps the MCMC will make in the chain before finishing. How long this should be depends on the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model and the precision of the answer required. The default value of 10,000,000 is entirely arbitrary and should be adjusted according to the size of your dataset. In order to examine whether a particular chain length is adequate, the resulting log file can be analysed using Tracer. The aim is to set the chain length so as to achieve a reasonable effective sample size (ESS). 

The next couple of options specify how often the current parameter values should be displayed on the screen and recorded in the log file. The screen output is simply for monitoring the programs progress so can be set to any value (although if set too small, the sheer quantity of information being displayed on the screen may actually slow the program down). For the log file, the value should be set relative to the total length of the chain. Sampling too often will result in very large files with little extra benefit in terms of the precision of the analysis. Sample too infrequently and the log file will not contain much information about the distributions of the parameters. You probably want to aim to store no more than 10,000 samples so this should be set to the chain length / 10,000.
For this dataset let's initially setting the chain length to 100,000 as this will run reasonably quickly on most modern computers.
The final two options give the file names of the log files for the parameters and the trees. These will be set to a default based on the name of the imported NEXUS file but feel free to change these.

\section{Running BEAST}
 
At this point we are ready to generate a BEAST XML file and to use this to run BEAST and perform the analysis. To do this, either select the \it{Generate BEAST File...} option from the File menu or click the similarly labelled button at the bottom of the window. Choose a name for the file (for example, \texttt{Dengue4.env.xml}) and save the file.  Leave the BEAUti window running for the moment as it may be necessary to adjust the options later on in this tutorial.

The precise instructions for running BEAST depend on the operating system so the user should consult the README text file included with the program.  However, for all platforms, BEAST reads the XML file, and generates the log file and trees file specified in BEAUti. It will also report information about the MCMC chain to the screen. When it has finished running, the log and trees file can be further processed to obtain estimates of the parameters of the model.

\section{Analysing the BEAST output using Tracer}

Tracer is a graphical application for summarizing the results of BEAST MCMC analyses (and other MCMC applications such as MrBayes). It can be used to obtain marginal posterior distributions of continuous parameter, diagnose problems with the MCMC analysis and to graphically reconstruct the demographic history of the sequences (in conjunction with the coalescent priors implemented in BEAST).

The exact instructions for running Tracer differs depending on which computer you are using. Please see the README text file that was distributed with the version you downloaded. Once running, Tracer will look similar irrespective of which computer system it is running on. For this tutorial, the Mac OS X version will be shown but the Linux \& Windows versions will have exactly the same layout and functionality.

Select the \it{Open...} option from the File menu. Select the log file that you created in previous section. The file will load and you will presented with a window similar to the one below (Figure~\ref{fig:tracerFigure}).. Remember that BEAST is a stochastic program so the actual numbers will not be exactly the same.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\scalebox{0.5}{\includegraphics{Figure_Tracer.png}}
\end{center}
\caption{The Tracer main window}
\label{fig:tracerFigure}
\end{figure}

On the left hand side is the name of the log file loaded and the traces that it contains. There are traces for the likelihood (this is the combined log likelihood of the tree and the coalescent model), and the continuous parameters. Selecting a trace on the left brings up analyses for this trace on the right hand side depending on tab that is selected. In the picture above, the log likelihood trace is selected and various statistics of this trace is shown under the Estimates tab.

Note that the Effective Sample Sizes(ESSs) for all the traces are small (ESSs less than 100 are highlighted in red by Tracer). This is not good. A low ESS means that the trace contained a lot of correlated samples and thus may not represent the posterior distribution well. In the bottom right of the window is a frequency plot of the samples which as expected given the low ESSs is extremely rough.

In the top right of the window is a table of calculated statistics for the selected trace. The statistics and their meaning are described in the table below.

\begin{itemize}
\item Mean
The mean value of the sampled trace across the chain (excluding the burn-in).
\item Stdev
The standard deviation of the mean. This takes into account the effective sample size so a small ESS will give a large Stdev.
\item Median
The median value of the sampled trace across the chain (excluding the burn-in).
\item 95\% HPD Lower
The lower bound of the highest posterior density (HPD) interval. The HPD is a credible set that contains 95\% of the sampled values.
\item 95\% HPD Upper
The upper bound of the highest posterior density (HPD) interval. The HPD is a credible set that contains 95\% of the sampled values.
\item Auto-Correlation Time (ACT)
The number of states in the MCMC chain that two samples have to be from each other for them to be uncorrelated. The ACT is estimated from the samples in the trace (excluding the burn-in).
\item Effective Sample Size (ESS)
The ESS is the number of independent samples that the trace is equivalent to. This is calculated as the chain length (excluding the burn-in) divided by the ACT.
\end{itemize}

If we select the Trace we can view the raw trace, that is, the sampled values against the step in the MCMC chain (Figure~\ref{fig:tracerFigure2}). Here you can see how the samples are correlated. There are only 100 samples in the trace (we ran the MCMC for 100,000 steps sampling every 1000) but it is clear that adjacent samples often tend to have similar values. The ESS for the likelihood is about 50 so we are only getting half the amount of independent samples as actual samples. Essentially this simply looks as if we need to run the chain for longer. Given the lowest ESS (for the coalescent likelihood) is 27, it would suggest that we have to run it for 4 times longer to get ESSs that are > 100. However it would be better to aim higher so lets go for a chain length of 1,000,000. Go back to \ref{section:Setting the MCMC options} and create a new BEAST XML file with a longer chain length. Now run BEAST and load the new log file into Tracer (you need to quit and restart Tracer to clear out the old log file). You should now have something like figure \ref{fig:tracerFigure3}.

This is much better. The ESSs are now all > 350 and the frequency plot is starting to show a reasonable curve. Click on the Trace tab and look at the raw trace plot \ref{fig:tracerFigure4}

Again this is more like what we are aiming for - we call this plot the hairy catapiller. There are now 1000 samples making up this plot and with an ESS of about 500 there is still auto-correlation between the samples but 500 effectively independent samples is pretty respectable. There are no obvious trends in the plot suggesting that the MCMC was still converging and there are no large-scale fluctuations in the trace suggesting poor mixing. Diagnosis of trace plots will be delt with in a another tutorial.
As we are happy with the behaviour of log-likelihood we can now move on to one of the parameters of interest: mutation rate. Select siteModel1.mu in the left-hand table. This is the mutation rate of the first codon position. Now choose the density plot by selecting the tab labelled Density. This shows a plot of the posterior probability density of this parameter. You should see a plot similar to this one:

As you can see the posterior probability density is a reasonable looking bell-shaped curve. There is some stochastic noise which would be reduced if we ran the chain for longer but we already have a pretty good estimate of the mean and credible interval. You can overlay the density plots of multiple traces in order to compare them (it is up to the user whether they are comparable on the the same axis or not). Select the mutation rates for all three codon positions in the table to the left. You can either click and drag to select multiple traces or click on the top trace and shift-click on the bottom trace. You will now see the posterior probability densities for the mutation rate at all three codon positions over-layed.
