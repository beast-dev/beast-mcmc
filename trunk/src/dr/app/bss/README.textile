Fast & furious sequence simulator in Beagle.  
   
h1. TODO

* terminal tab for outputs
* display tree filename w-out canonical path in partitions panel combobox (also when clicked)
* nucleotide/codon frequencies with compatible substitution models
* parallel tree traversal:
  # start asynch task
  tree -> left
  # start asynch task
  tree -> right
  # wait
* test with large topologies ~ 15000 taxa
* frequency labels for codon triplets
* ancestral sequence in XML Generator and GUI
* command line interface
  - complex argument for partitions 
* simulating indels
