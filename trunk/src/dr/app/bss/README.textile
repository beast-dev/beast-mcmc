Fast & furious sequence simulator in Beagle.  
   
h1. TODO

* nucleotide/codon frequencies with compatible substitution models
* setup recent files in main menu
* parallel tree traversal:
  # start asynch task
  tree -> left
  # start asynch task
  tree -> right
  # wait
* site rate model with invariant sites
* check on:
 - alpha value in gamma site rate model > 0
 - clock rate > 0 
 - nucleotide/codon frequencies > 0
* test with large topologies ~ 15000 taxa
* frequency labels for codon triplets
* ancestral sequence in XML Generator and GUI
* command line interface
  - should accept data saved from UI
* simulating indels
